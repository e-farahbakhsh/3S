## Introduction
This repository deals with analysing Stream Sediment Samples (3S) which are known as one of the important sample types used for mineral prospecting in preliminary stages of the geochemical exploration.
The codes available here are as follows:

* Weighted Drainage Catchment Basin (WDCB)

## Usage
### WDCB
This is a discrete mapping approach to delineate geochemical anomalies. WDCB is used to weigh catchment basins according to the geochemical parameters assigned to stream sediment samples collected within each catchment basin. These parameters can be concentration values of different elements, factor scores determined by factor analysis on a set of elements or any other parameters which deals with the initial concentration values of elements measured for each stream sediment sample.
The input file to this code have to be prepared in three columns or more. Number of rows equal to number of samples. First and second columns are respectively "Basin ID" and "Point ID". Third column to the last include geochemical parameters assigned to each point.
